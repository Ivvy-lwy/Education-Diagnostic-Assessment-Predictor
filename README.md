# Online Education Diagnostic Assessment Predictor

## Overview
This project is part of the University of Toronto CSC311 Introduction to Machine Learning Fall 2021 coursework. It focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of students correctly answering specific diagnostic questions in an online education setting. The predictions are based on the students' prior responses to other questions and the responses from other students.

## Objective
- Experiment with existing machine learning algorithms to solve real-world tasks.
- Modify and enhance algorithms to achieve improved performance.
- Analyze and report the findings and results obtained from the implemented models.

## Background
In the realm of online education platforms, assessing a student's understanding of course material is crucial. This project revolves around creating models that can effectively predict a student's performance on diagnostic questions, which are designed to reveal common misconceptions related to the course material.

## Project Structure
- `code/`: Contains all the Python code used for both Part A and B of the project.
- `data/`: Holds the datasets required for the project.
- `report/`: Includes the final report PDF detailing the findings and analysis of the project.
